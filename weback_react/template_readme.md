This template creates a Webpack 4 project with React 16, Babel, ES Lint and Stylus.

It includes npm scripts to run ES Lint, build the project in dev or prod mode, clean the project and run Webpack Dev Server.

After creating the project, cd into the directory it created and type `npm install` to install all the dependencies.

You can then type `npm start` to run the dev server and go to `localhost:8080` in your browser to view the site.

Feel free to customize this template so that it fits your needs.
